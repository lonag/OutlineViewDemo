# Outline view API

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo and open `OutlineViewDemo.xcodeproj`
1. Build and Run the app
1. Double-Click any Starred item
1. It becomes Unstarred and moves to the bottom
1. Double-Click any Unstarred item
1. It becomes Starred and moves to the top

Press and hold `Shift` during Double-Click to slow down animation, press and hold `Option` to avoid animation.

## Problem

I want the item to animate transition between states, but instead it immediately becomes the new cell and then animates.

**How do I do this?**
